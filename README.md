## üìñ Summary

**PacketSprinter** is a Burp Suite extension that simplifies and enhances HTTP/2 single-packet attack testing by streamlining the otherwise cumbersome process of duplicating, editing, and sending grouped parallel requests within an intuitive UI that displays a side-by-side comparison of requests and responses. PacketSprinter eliminates the need to switch between multiple Repeater tabs, saving time and reducing the chances of error.

This extension is inspired by the research of [James Kettle](https://portswigger.net/research/the-single-packet-attack-making-remote-race-conditions-local), who introduced the **single-packet attack** as a groundbreaking method to make remote race condition testing as effective as local testing. PacketSprinter makes this technique accessible, efficient, and seamless for penetration testers and bug bounty hunters.

## üåü Features

- **HTTP/2 Single-Packet Attack Support**: Implements advanced race condition testing using the single-packet attack technique.
- **Unified UI**: Manage all requests and responses within the same tab‚Äîno need to switch between multiple Repeater tabs.
- **Request Duplication Made Easy**: Duplicate requests in bulk with a customizable count and seamlessly edit them in the same interface.
- **Side-by-Side Response Comparison**: View responses side-by-side with built-in highlighting for differences in status codes, headers, and body content.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Automates the `Send requests in parallel` process, reducing manual effort and improving accuracy.
- **Customizable Controls**: Adjust the number of duplicate requests.

## üõ†Ô∏è Limitations 

1. **HTTP/1.1 Support**:  
   - Currently, **HTTP/1.1 last-byte synchronization** is **not supported**. Support for this feature is actively being developed and will be included in the next release.  
   - Learn more about HTTP/1.1 last-byte synchronization in the [Burp Suite documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/repeater/send-group).

2. **HTTP/3 Support**:  
   - **Not supported at this time**. While HTTP/3 may eventually be added, there are no plans for implementation in the near future.  

3. **Server Behavior Dependency**:  
   - The effectiveness of race condition testing relies heavily on how the target server processes concurrent requests.

PacketSprinter is provided **"as is"** without any warranties or guarantees. Users are solely responsible for ensuring proper authorization before testing web applications. Unauthorized testing may violate applicable laws and could result in legal consequences.

**Risks and Potential Impact**:
- Overwhelming a target server with concurrent requests can lead to service disruption or unintentional denial-of-service (DoS) conditions.
- Misconfigured requests may produce inaccurate results or fail to detect vulnerabilities.

Use responsibly and ensure compliance with applicable laws and ethical guidelines.
